# Climate-Research

## ENSO Composite
* xarray
* NOAA Climate data from https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/
* SST, Precipitation, PDSI, and Soil Moisture
* Composites with Nino3.4 index (Oceanic Ni√±o Index, ONI)

## Indian Monsoon Research with CAM experiments
* The Indian Monsoon Circulation Response to El Nino Diabatic Heating (CAM-expt-paper-1.pdf)
* Tropical Stationary Wave Response to ENSO: Diabatic Heating Influence on the Indian Summer Monsoon(CAM-expt-paper-2.pdf)

## Coding sample and output 
* The module of a new temperature tendency, add_attend.F90 was applied in CESM to correct diabatic heating bias. (Jang_coding_Fortran_CESM_module.pdf)
* Drought index (SPI) was calculated in NCL and shell scripts with the CMIP5 multi-model outputs. (sh_NCL_SPI.pdf)
* Taylor Diagram of SPI index from the multi-model outputs.(EOF also applied)

## Research Summary (Jang_research.pdf)
* Global drought in future climate (CMIP5)
* US drought with Pacific SST (Idealized SST experiment outputs) 
* Diabatic heating bias correction in CESM
